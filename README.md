# Dynamics of node influence in network growth models

This repository contains python scripts for 3 experiments conducted in our study:
* nodeVisibility_boxPlots.py: Tracking our proposed metric, "Node Visibility" for different network growth models, namely, Barabasi-Albert model, fitness-based models, and spatial model.
* spatialLocalModel.py: Implementation of our proposed network growth model, location-based spatial model.
* trackNode_10001.py: Tracking the influence of a leader node under different network growth models.
